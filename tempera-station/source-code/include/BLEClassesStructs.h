/* 
* Data structure for the characteristics of the environmental sensing service.
*
* This characteristic uses a medfloat16 value (see ISO/IEEE 11073-20601) according to the specifications. 
* For our purpose we simplify this by using a scaled uint16_t value.
* To scale the value, we change the units from kg/m^3 to g/m^3.
* The accuracy translates to a multiplier that has to be used when writing a value to a characteristic.
* So if we want to transmit a temperature of 4 Â°C we need to write a value of 4/0.01 = 400 to the characteristic.
